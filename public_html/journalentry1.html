                <p>There’s not much time left to catch this wonderful exhibition, revealing the genius of Tove Jansson. </p>

                <p>One of the most celebrated illustrators of the 20th century, Jansson is known internationally as the creator of the Moomin characters and books, a phenomenon which continues to stretch across generations. Her wider outputs of graphic illustration and painting, however, are relatively unseen outside her home country of Finland.</p>

                <p>150 works, including a selection of self-portraits and paintings never seen before in the UK reintroduce Jansson as an artist of exceptional breadth and talent and provide an insightful overview of the key stages of her prolific career. Ultimately, Jansson’s most enduring desire was to be an artist and this exhibition reveals the unwavering passion that kept her working and exhibiting as an accomplished fine artist alongside her career in graphic illustration.</p>
